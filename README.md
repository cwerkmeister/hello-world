# hello-world
First project ever

So I am new to coding, and am enjoying what I have learned about it so far. I am going through the course at Free Code Camp and so far it is going well. I have also tried Code Academy but found myself stuck and lost momentum.

I am enjoying Free Code Camp, and can't wait until i learn enough to put it to real world use.
